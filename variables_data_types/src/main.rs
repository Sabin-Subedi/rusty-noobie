        a. Integer
            i for signed and u for unsigned
            range for signed -> -2^n-1 to (2^n-1)-1 eg: for 8bit -> -128 to 127
            range for unsinged -> 0 to 2^n -1 eg: for 8 bit -> 0 to 255

        b. Floating-point
            has two types f32 with single precision and f64 for double precision
            f64 is default float

        c. Boolean Types
            True and false
            Mostly useful for the control flow of the applcation

        d. Character Types
            primtive alphabet data type
            specified by a single quote ''
            4 bytes in size and represents  a unicode scalar value

           it can group multiple values into one type.

           a. Tuple type
               it has fixed length: once declared never grow or shrink
               can have multiple data types in one tuple
               can access value using the . with the index or desctructuring

           b. Array
               it is collection of multiple values of same data types
               array in rust has fixed length
               Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap
